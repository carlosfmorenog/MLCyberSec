              "ho ho ho , we ' re around to that most wonderful time of the year - - - neon leaders retreat time !\n",
              "i know that this time of year is extremely hectic , and that it ' s tough to think about anything past the holidays , but life does go on past the week of december 25 through january 1 , and that ' s what i ' d like you to think about for a minute .\n",
              "on the calender that i handed out at the beginning of the fall semester , the retreat was scheduled for the weekend of january 5 - 6 . but because of a youth ministers conference that brad and dustin are connected with that week , we ' re going to change the date to the following weekend , january 12 - 13 . now comes the part you need to think about .\n",
              "i think we all agree that it ' s important for us to get together and have some time to recharge our batteries before we get to far into the spring semester , but it can be a lot of trouble and difficult for us to get away without kids , etc . so , brad came up with a potential alternative for how we can get together on that weekend , and then you can let me know which you prefer .\n",
              "the first option would be to have a retreat similar to what we ' ve done the past several years . this year we could go to the heartland country inn ( www . . com ) outside of brenham . it ' s a nice place , where we ' d have a 13 - bedroom and a 5 - bedroom house side by side . it ' s in the country , real relaxing , but also close to brenham and only about one hour and 15 minutes from here . we can golf , shop in the antique and craft stores in brenham , eat dinner together at the ranch , and spend time with each other . we ' d meet on saturday , and then return on sunday morning , just like what we ' ve done in the past .\n",
              "the second option would be to stay here in houston , have dinner together at a nice restaurant , and then have dessert and a time for visiting and recharging at one of our homes on that saturday evening . this might be easier , but the trade off would be that we wouldn ' t have as much time together . i ' ll let you decide .\n",
              "email me back with what would be your preference , and of course if you ' re available on that weekend . the democratic process will prevail - - majority vote will rule ! let me hear from you as soon as possible , preferably by the end of the weekend . and if the vote doesn ' t go your way , no complaining allowed ( like i tend to do ! )\n",
              "have a great weekend , great golf , great fishing , great shopping , or whatever makes you happy !\n",

              "please find attached spreadsheet that compares hot days from may 2000 and may 2001 . there are two tabs , one tab contains the days may 16 - 18 , 2000 and the other tab contains the days may 14 - 18 , 2001 . each tab contains both the load data and temp data particular to the days in question . the days most directly comparable are may 17 , 2001 ( thursday ) and may 18 , 2000 ( thursday ) , although the two days preceding may 18 , 2000 were slightly warmer than the two days preceding may 17 , 2001 . the peak on 5 / 17 / 2001 , 44 , 923 mw , is 2 . 78 % higher than the peak on 5 / 18 / 2000 , 43 , 709 mw . with similarly warm days before 5 / 17 / 2001 as there were before 5 / 18 / 2000 , the peak would obviously have been even higher . this would put the year - over - year growth in excess of 3 % . i believe this falls right in line with the growth rate year - over - year from an earlier analysis , somewhere in the range of 3 . 5 % to 4 % .\n",

the year - - - neon leaders retreat time !\ni know that this time of year is extremely hectic , and that it ' s tough to think about anything past the holidays , but life does go on past the week of december 25 through january 1 , and that ' s what i ' d like you to think about for a minute .\non the calender that i handed out at the beginning of the fall semester , the retreat was scheduled for the weekend of january 5 - 6 . but because of a youth ministers conference that brad and dustin are connected with that week , we ' re going to change the date to the following weekend , january 12 - 13 . now comes the part you need to think about .\ni think we all agree that it ' s important for us to get together and have some time to recharge our batteries before we get to far into the spring semester , but it can be a lot of trouble and difficult for us to get away without kids , etc . so , brad came up with a potential alternative for how we can get together on that weekend , and then you can let me know which you prefer .\nthe first option would be to have a retreat similar to what we ' ve done the past several years . this year we could go to the heartland country inn ( www . . com ) outside of brenham . it ' s a nice place , where we ' d have a 13 - bedroom and a 5 - bedroom house side by side . it ' s in the country , real relaxing , but also close to brenham and only about one hour and 15 minutes from here . we can golf , shop in the antique and craft stores in brenham , eat dinner together at the ranch , and spend time with each other . we ' d meet on saturday , and then return on sunday morning , just like what we ' ve done in the past .\nthe second option would be to stay here in houston , have dinner together at a nice restaurant , and then have dessert and a time for visiting and recharging at one of our homes on that saturday evening . this might be easier , but the trade off would be that we wouldn ' t have as much time together . i ' ll let you decide .\nemail me back with what would be your preference , and of course if you ' re available on that weekend . the democratic process will prevail - - majority vote will rule ! let me hear from

gilbert - smith / corp / enron @ enron\ncc : eric saibi / corp / enron @ enron\nsubject : ercot load comparison\nplease find attached spreadsheet that compares hot days from may 2000 and may 2001 . there are two tabs , one tab contains the days may 16 - 18 , 2000 and the other tab contains the days may 14 - 18 , 2001 . each tab contains both the load data and temp data particular to the days in question . the days most directly comparable are may 17 , 2001 ( thursday ) and may 18 , 2000 ( thursday ) , although the two days preceding may 18 , 2000 were slightly warmer than the two days preceding may 17 , 2001 . the peak on 5 / 17 / 2001 , 44 , 923 mw , is 2 . 78 % higher than the peak on 5 / 18 / 2000 , 43 , 709 mw . with similarly warm days before 5 / 17 / 2001 as there were before 5 / 18 / 2000 , the peak would obviously have been even higher . this would put the year - over - year growth in excess of 3 % . i believe this falls right in line with the growth rate year - over - year from an earlier analysis , somewhere in the range of 3 . 5 % to 4 % .\nlet me know if you have any questions or comments .

project montana oil and\ngas has prepared a detailed project description .\nproject history\nthe sylvan lake oil and gas field was discovered in the late 1950 ' s and\nhas produced over 40 million barrels ( mbbls ) of high quality crude oil\nand 50 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) of associated natural gas ,\npredominantly from the mississippian pekisko and shunda formations . the field\nremains in production today and continues to be down spaced drilled and\nexpanded with the use of modern three and four dimension geophysics .\nthe original freehold lease on section 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m was leased to a major\noil company , as was most of the sylvan lake field itself . an\nexploratory well was drilled by this major company in 7 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m in 1958 and was\nabandoned after finding the shunda and pekisko formations completely\neroded by post depositional cutting . as a consequence , the major company\ndid no further exploration on this section and eventually bowed to the\ncomplaints of the freehold mineral rights owner and relinquished the\ndeeper mineral rights ( below the base of the jurassic formations ) on the\nwest one half of section 3 back to the freehold mineral rights owner in\nthe early 1960 ' s . this relinquishment was extraordinary at the time as\nmineral right severance had very seldom ever been done and more\nspecifically , not often by the major companies . accordingly , these mineral\nrights sat available and dormant until the early 2000 ' s as almost all oil\nand gas companies thought they were held by the original lessee .\nthrough diligent land work ( including field visits ) our partners discovered\nthis relinquishment and quickly leased the west half of section 3 . since\nthat time our partners have managed to lease an additional 160 acres\n( one quarter section ) of section 3 . energy 51 has the right to earn 50 %\nof this prospect ( possibly 75 % ) with the drilling of a test well in\n5 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m .\nland discussion\nour partners have secured a 100 % working interest in the west half and\nnortheast quarter of section 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m . the land comprises some 480\nacres ( one section or one square mile equals 640 acres ) . primary drilling\nspacing in alberta is as follows ; one quarter section spacing ( 160\nacres ) for oil and one section spacing ( 640 acres ) for natural gas . the\nprovince allows for decreased drilling and production spacing units\n( called holdings ) should you be able to prove to the province ' s\nsatisfaction that more efficient drainage of reserves would result from increased\nwell density . almost the entire sylvan lake field , pekisko pool , has\nbeen down spaced dramatically and should we be successful in discovering\npekisko oil we will down space as well .\ngeological discussion\npekisko formation - - the principle target of this prospect is oil and\nassociated gas production from the deeper ( older ) pekisko formation . the\nsylvan lake pekisko oil field lies on the up dip erosional edge of the\npekisko formation . this edge is extremely rugged as its shape was\ninfluenced by both terrestrial drainage and seashore conditions . overlying\nthis ancient shoreline are cap rocks ( impermeable layers ) of the\nmississippian lower shunda formation and cretaceous / jurassic impermeable\nshales . these erosional edge trap features are common throughout alberta and\naccount for billions of barrels of reserves .\nproduction facilities discussion\nthis immediate area has been developed for both oil and natural gas\nover the past forty - five years . accordingly a multitude of gas gathering\nand processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been\nconstructed .\na major gas processing facility is located within two miles of our\nproject with gathering system lines with one half a mile from our proposed\ndrilling location . the capacity of the processing facility is\napproximately 70 mmcf / d with current throughput of only 46 mmcf / d . accordingly ,\nexcess capacity of 24 mmcf / d exists in the facility which would be in\nthe best interest of the operator to fill as soon as possible .\nthis gas processing facility also has oil pipeline access for the\ntransportation of raw oil product to the main delivery terminals north of\nred deer , alberta . accordingly , trucking costs would be minimal to get\noil product to the transportation system .\nfor more detailed project description please see news release dated\n( fri , apr 29 ) .\ngood luck and successfu | trading .\nconclusion :\nthe examples above show the

Subject: feb 12 th sale to aquila\nfyi\ndaren - - - on the 12 th , there is a sale to aquila on the header system , for\n10 , 000 . . . . . . . . i think we were supplying it with aec . for whatever reason , i\nhad the aec 10 . 0 @ # 11230 into midcon . . . which isnt right because there was no\nmarket for it , and midcon wasnt looking for it , but the aquila deal was at\n# 700 on wgr ( aquila ) . so i went ahead and changed the aec ticket to match up\nwith the aquila deal . let me know if you think it is incorrect .\nthanks ,\nmark

wonderful time of the year - - - neon leaders retreat time !\ni know that this time of year is extremely hectic , and that it ' s tough to think about anything past the holidays , but life does go on past the week of december 25 through january 1 , and that ' s what i ' d like you to think about for a minute .\non the calender that i handed out at the beginning of the fall semester , the retreat was scheduled for the weekend of january 5 - 6 . but because of a youth ministers conference that brad and dustin are connected with that week , we ' re going to change the date to the following weekend , january 12 - 13 . now comes the part you need to think about .\ni think we all agree that it ' s important for us to get together and have some time to recharge our batteries before we get to far into the spring semester , but it can be a lot of trouble and difficult for us to get away without kids , etc . so , brad came up with a potential alternative for how we can get together on that weekend , and then you can let me know which you prefer .\nthe first option would be to have a retreat similar to what we ' ve done the past several years . this year we could go to the heartland country inn ( www . . com ) outside of brenham . it ' s a nice place , where we ' d have a 13 - bedroom and a 5 - bedroom house side by side . it ' s in the country , real relaxing , but also close to brenham and only about one hour and 15 minutes from here . we can golf , shop in the antique and craft stores in brenham , eat dinner together at the ranch , and spend time with each other . we ' d meet on saturday , and then return on sunday morning , just like what we ' ve done in the past .\nthe second option would be to stay here in houston , have dinner together at a nice restaurant , and then have dessert and a time for visiting and recharging at one of our homes on that saturday evening . this might be easier , but the trade off would be that we wouldn ' t have as much time together . i ' ll let you decide .\nemail me back with what would be your preference , and of course if you ' re available on that weekend . the democratic process will prevail - - majority vote will rule ! let me hear from you as soon as possible , preferably by the end of the weekend . and if the vote doesn ' t go your way , no complaining allowed ( like i tend to do ! )\nhave a great weekend , great golf , great fishing , great shopping , or whatever makes you happy !\nbobby

gilbert - smith / corp / enron @ enron\ncc : eric saibi / corp / enron @ enron\nsubject : ercot load comparison\nplease find attached spreadsheet that compares hot days from may 2000 and may 2001 . there are two tabs , one tab contains the days may 16 - 18 , 2000 and the other tab contains the days may 14 - 18 , 2001 . each tab contains both the load data and temp data particular to the days in question . the days most directly comparable are may 17 , 2001 ( thursday ) and may 18 , 2000 ( thursday ) , although the two days preceding may 18 , 2000 were slightly warmer than the two days preceding may 17 , 2001 . the peak on 5 / 17 / 2001 , 44 , 923 mw , is 2 . 78 \\% higher than the peak on 5 / 18 / 2000 , 43 , 709 mw . with similarly warm days before 5 / 17 / 2001 as there were before 5 / 18 / 2000 , the peak would obviously have been even higher . this would put the year - over - year growth in excess of 3 \\% . i believe this falls right in line with the growth rate year - over - year from an earlier analysis , somewhere in the range of 3 . 5 \\% to 4 \\% .\nlet me know if you have any questions or comments .

stocks made tripie and even\nquadruple returns .\nbreaking news ! !\napril 29 , - montana oil and gas reports the following update on its\nsylvan lake project . after several delays due to unseasonable weather and\nroad closures in the province of alberta , the contracted drilling rig\nwas moved onto location and ensign drilling has spudded the 5 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m\nwell . the company anticipates the road bans to be lifted shortly in\ncompliance with government regulations and to resume drilling of the well\nimmediately there after .\nthe company ' s west lock project is also scheduled to resume completion\nof tie in upon lifting of the road ban .\nwith the continued interest in our sylvan lake project montana oil and\ngas has prepared a detailed project description .\nproject history\nthe sylvan lake oil and gas field was discovered in the late 1950 ' s and\nhas produced over 40 million barrels ( mbbls ) of high quality crude oil\nand 50 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) of associated natural gas ,\npredominantly from the mississippian pekisko and shunda formations . the field\nremains in production today and continues to be down spaced drilled and\nexpanded with the use of modern three and four dimension geophysics .\nthe original freehold lease on section 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m was leased to a major\noil company , as was most of the sylvan lake field itself . an\nexploratory well was drilled by this major company in 7 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m in 1958 and was\nabandoned after finding the shunda and pekisko formations completely\neroded by post depositional cutting . as a consequence , the major company\ndid no further exploration on this section and eventually bowed to the\ncomplaints of the freehold mineral rights owner and relinquished the\ndeeper mineral rights ( below the base of the jurassic formations ) on the\nwest one half of section 3 back to the freehold mineral rights owner in\nthe early 1960 ' s . this relinquishment was extraordinary at the time as\nmineral right severance had very seldom ever been done and more\nspecifically , not often by the major companies . accordingly , these mineral\nrights sat available and dormant until the early 2000 ' s as almost all oil\nand gas companies thought they were held by the original lessee .\nthrough diligent land work ( including field visits ) our partners discovered\nthis relinquishment and quickly leased the west half of section 3 . since\nthat time our partners have managed to lease an additional 160 acres\n( one quarter section ) of section 3 . energy 51 has the right to earn 50 \\%\nof this prospect ( possibly 75 \\% ) with the drilling of a test well in\n5 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m .\nland discussion\nour partners have secured a 100 \\% working interest in the west half and\nnortheast quarter of section 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m . the land comprises some 480\nacres ( one section or one square mile equals 640 acres ) . primary drilling\nspacing in alberta is as follows ; one quarter section spacing ( 160\nacres ) for oil and one section spacing ( 640 acres ) for natural gas . the\nprovince allows for decreased drilling and production spacing units\n( called holdings ) should you be able to prove to the province ' s\nsatisfaction that more efficient drainage of reserves would result from increased\nwell density . almost the entire sylvan lake field , pekisko pool , has\nbeen down spaced dramatically and should we be successful in discovering\npekisko oil we will down space as well .\ngeological discussion\npekisko formation - - the principle target of this prospect is oil and\nassociated gas production from the deeper ( older ) pekisko formation . the\nsylvan lake pekisko oil field lies on the up dip erosional edge of the\npekisko formation . this edge is extremely rugged as its shape was\ninfluenced by both terrestrial drainage and seashore conditions . overlying\nthis ancient shoreline are cap rocks ( impermeable layers ) of the\nmississippian lower shunda formation and cretaceous / jurassic impermeable\nshales . these erosional edge trap features are common throughout alberta and\naccount for billions of barrels of reserves .\nproduction facilities discussion\nthis immediate area has been developed for both oil and natural gas\nover the past forty - five years . accordingly a multitude of gas gathering\nand processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been\nconstructed .\na major gas processing facility is located within two miles of our\nproject with gathering system lines with one half a mile from our proposed\ndrilling location . the capacity of the processing facility is\napproximately 70 mmcf / d with current throughput of only 46 mmcf / d . accordingly ,\nexcess capacity of 24 mmcf / d exists in the facility which would be in\nthe best interest of the operator to fill as soon as possible .\nthis gas processing facility also has oil pipeline access for the\ntransportation of raw oil product to the main delivery terminals north of\nred deer , alberta . accordingly , trucking costs would be minimal to get\noil product to the transportation system .\nfor more detailed

is a sale to aquila on the header system , for\n10 , 000 . . . . . . . . i think we were supplying it with aec . for whatever reason , i\nhad the aec 10 . 0 @ \\# 11230 into midcon . . . which isnt right because there was no\nmarket for it , and midcon wasnt looking for it , but the aquila deal was at\n\\# 700 on wgr ( aquila ) . so i went ahead and changed the aec ticket to match up\nwith the aquila deal . let me know if you think it is incorrect .\nthanks ,\nmark

              "3    Subject: neon retreat\\nho ho ho , we ' re around to that most wonderful time of the year - - - neon leaders retreat time !\\ni know that this time of year is extremely hectic , and that it ' s tough to think about anything past the holidays , but life does go on past the week of december 25 through january 1 , and that ' s what i ' d like you to think about for a minute .\\non the calender that i handed out at the beginning of the fall semester , the retreat was scheduled for the weekend of january 5 - 6 . but because of a youth ministers conference that brad and dustin are connected with that week , we ' re going to change the date to the following weekend , january 12 - 13 . now comes the part you need to think about .\\ni think we all agree that it ' s important for us to get together and have some time to recharge our batteries before we get to far into the spring semester , but it can be a lot of trouble and difficult for us to get away without kids , etc . so , brad came up with a potential alternative for how we can get together on that weekend , and then you can let me know which you prefer .\\nthe first option would be to have a retreat similar to what we ' ve done the past several years . this year we could go to the heartland country inn ( www . . com ) outside of brenham . it ' s a nice place , where we ' d have a 13 - bedroom and a 5 - bedroom house side by side . it ' s in the country , real relaxing , but also close to brenham and only about one hour and 15 minutes from here . we can golf , shop in the antique and craft stores in brenham , eat dinner together at the ranch , and spend time with each other . we ' d meet on saturday , and then return on sunday morning , just like what we ' ve done in the past .\\nthe second option would be to stay here in houston , have dinner together at a nice restaurant , and then have dessert and a time for visiting and recharging at one of our homes on that saturday evening . this might be easier , but the trade off would be that we wouldn ' t have as much time together . i ' ll let you decide .\\nemail me back with what would be your preference , and of course if you ' re available on that weekend . the democratic process will prevail - - majority vote will rule ! let me hear from you as soon as possible , preferably by the end of the weekend . and if the vote doesn ' t go your way , no complaining allowed ( like i tend to do ! )\\nhave a great weekend , great golf , great fishing , great shopping , or whatever makes you happy !\\nbobby

smith / corp / enron @ enron\\ncc : eric saibi / corp / enron @ enron\\nsubject : ercot load comparison\\nplease find attached spreadsheet that compares hot days from may 2000 and may 2001 . there are two tabs , one tab contains the days may 16 - 18 , 2000 and the other tab contains the days may 14 - 18 , 2001 . each tab contains both the load data and temp data particular to the days in question . the days most directly comparable are may 17 , 2001 ( thursday ) and may 18 , 2000 ( thursday ) , although the two days preceding may 18 , 2000 were slightly warmer than the two days preceding may 17 , 2001 . the peak on 5 / 17 / 2001 , 44 , 923 mw , is 2 . 78 % higher than the peak on 5 / 18 / 2000 , 43 , 709 mw . with similarly warm days before 5 / 17 / 2001 as there were before 5 / 18 / 2000 , the peak would obviously have been even higher . this would put the year - over - year growth in excess of 3 % . i believe this falls right in line with the growth rate year - over - year from an earlier analysis , somewhere in the range of 3 . 5 % to 4 % .\\nlet me know if you have any questions or comments .

one quarter section spacing ( 160\\nacres ) for oil and one section spacing ( 640 acres ) for natural gas . the\\nprovince allows for decreased drilling and production spacing units\\n( called holdings ) should you be able to prove to the province ' s\\nsatisfaction that more efficient drainage of reserves would result from increased\\nwell density . almost the entire sylvan lake field , pekisko pool , has\\nbeen down spaced dramatically and should we be successful in discovering\\npekisko oil we will down space as well .\\ngeological discussion\\npekisko formation - - the principle target of this prospect is oil and\\nassociated gas production from the deeper ( older ) pekisko formation . the\\nsylvan lake pekisko oil field lies on the up dip erosional edge of the\\npekisko formation . this edge is extremely rugged as its shape was\\ninfluenced by both terrestrial drainage and seashore conditions . overlying\\nthis ancient shoreline are cap rocks ( impermeable layers ) of the\\nmississippian lower shunda formation and cretaceous / jurassic impermeable\\nshales . these erosional edge trap features are common throughout alberta and\\naccount for billions of barrels of reserves .\\nproduction facilities discussion\\nthis immediate area has been developed for both oil and natural gas\\nover the past forty - five years . accordingly a multitude of gas gathering\\nand processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been\\nconstructed .\\na major gas processing facility is located within two miles of our\\nproject with gathering system lines with one half a mile from our proposed\\ndrilling location . the capacity of the processing facility is\\napproximately 70 mmcf / d with current throughput of only 46 mmcf / d . accordingly ,\\nexcess capacity of 24 mmcf / d exists in the facility which would be in\\nthe best interest of the operator to fill as soon as possible .\\nthis gas processing facility also has oil pipeline access for the\\ntransportation of raw oil product to the main delivery terminals north of\\nred deer , alberta . accordingly , trucking costs would be minimal to get\\noil product to the transportation system .\\nfor more detailed project description please see news release dated\\n( fri , apr 29 ) .\\ngood luck and successfu | trading .\\nconclusion :\\nthe examples above show the awesome , earning potential of little known\\ncompanies that explode onto investor ' s radar screens ;

              "5154 Subject: feb 12 th sale to aquila\\nfyi\\ndaren - - - on the 12 th , there is a sale to aquila on the header system , for\\n10 , 000 . . . . . . . . i think we were supplying it with aec . for whatever reason , i\\nhad the aec 10 . 0 @ # 11230 into midcon . . . which isnt right because there was no\\nmarket for it , and midcon wasnt looking for it , but the aquila deal was at\\n# 700 on wgr ( aquila ) . so i went ahead and changed the aec ticket to match up\\nwith the aquila deal . let me know if you think it is incorrect .\\nthanks ,\\nmark

been working with fred on getting\\nsome allocations resolved for several different months . transco told us they\\nwould not go back and reallocate due to the statute of limitations ( 6\\nmonths ) . february had a significant amount not allocated . we just need a\\ndeal set up so we can write these volumes off . let me know if you have any\\nmore questions .\\naim\\nclem cernosek\\n12 / 12 / 2000
